This is a five-in-a-row game, but for some reason the board — which had been lying flat on the ground — suddenly stood upright. However, as avid gamers we won't give up playing because of that, so the game begins now. The rules are as follows: first, as everyone knows, getting five pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. Second, because the board has stood upright, you cannot choose which row to place a piece in; instead you place a piece in the column you choose, and which row it ends up in depends on how many pieces are already in that column — just like in Tetris.
